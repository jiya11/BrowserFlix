# BrowserFlix 🍿

This project is a React-based web application that lets you search for movies and explore detailed information about films via The Movie Database (TMDB) API.

## 🔍 Search & Discover

Find your next favorite movie with an intuitive search feature. Simply enter a movie title in the search bar, and BrowserFlix will fetch matching results from the TMDB database in real-time. Movie results are displayed with their posters, titles, and brief info, making it easy to browse through the options at a glance.

### 🎞️ Detailed Movie Info

Dive deeper into any film with a dedicated movie details page. Clicking on the "Show Details" button from the results opens a detail view showing comprehensive information: poster or backdrop image, synopsis/overview, release date, genre, and user ratings. BrowserFlix may also provide additional details like cast information or similar movie recommendations (using TMDB’s data) to enhance your exploration. The detail view is designed for clarity, allowing you to absorb all the key information about a film in one place.
